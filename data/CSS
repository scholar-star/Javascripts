Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a sytle sheet language used of describing the presentation of a 
document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style fo 
web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any 
XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or 
on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most 
websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user 
interfaces for may mobile applications.
